## Validation Requirements (Possibly Set in Database)
### DATA VALIDATION

#### AFTER UPDATE ON Reimbursements
AvailableReimburstment = TotalReimburstment($1000) – PendingReimburstments – AwardedReimburstments

#### AFTER UPDATE ON Event
A passing grade is needed for reimbursement.

#### BEFORE INSERT ON Reimbursements
Projected reimbursement adjusts to amount available if event cost exceeds available amount.

#### AFTER UPDATE ON ManagerApprovals
Reimbursement status proceeds in order:
  Pending Benefits Coordinator Approval
  Pending Passing Grade or Presentation
  Pending Management Approval
  Reimbursment Awarded

#### BEFORE UPDATE ON ManagerApprovals
If the Direct Supervisor is also a Department Head, then the Department Head approval is skipped.
Upon confirmation, the amount is awarded to the requestor.

#### AFTER UPDATE ON Reimbursements
Reimbursments that are awards with larger amounts must be marked as exceeding available funds for reporting purposes.


### TIME VALIDATION

The amount available to an employee is reset on the new year.

Tuition Reimbursement Form must be filled out one week prior to the start of the event.

If the course is < 2 weeks long, the request is marked urgent.

If DirSupervisor or DeptHead approval is not made in a timely matter, the request is auto-approved. 

If Benefits Coordinator approval is not made in a timely matter, an escalation email should be sent to the Benefits Coordinator’s Direct Supervisor.
