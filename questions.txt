Are the Grading Formats standard A-F Letter grades?  Would Presentations have simpler Grading Formats (Pending, Failed, Passed)?
  up to me (proper college)

Can Pending Reimbursements be deleted at any time?
  Is it only possible if a Benefits Coordinator changes the amount?
  Otherwise side affect can occur for Available Reimbursement
