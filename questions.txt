Are the Direct Supervisors, Department Heads, and Benefits Coordinators all employee who can also submit reimbursements?
  If so, can they approve they're own request (since there are still two others who must also approve it)?

BenCo is Benefits Coordinator?

Are the Grading Formats standard A-F Letter grades?  Would Presentations have simpler Grading Formats (Pending, Failed, Passed)?
